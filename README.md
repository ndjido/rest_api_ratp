# rest_api_ratp
API Rest of the open data ratp


This project aims to offer an api rest that consumes the web service soap proposed by the open-data team of the ratp.
You can participate in the construction of this project. Any remarks are good to take

I use node.js and restify to create the api and soap-node to consume the soap of the ratp.

You can test it here :
